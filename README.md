# openisaac
This app WILL NOT open Isaac unless you have a specfic setting
So this app was intended to not only open Isaac but any app you please
It works by clicking on your taskbar and then pressing enter to skip the "The Binding of Isaac"'s startup screen
You can customize this in any way you want but honestly you'd be better off without my jank-ass code
Just make your own shit
